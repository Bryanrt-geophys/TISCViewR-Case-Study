# The Coding

In this directory, the user will find all functions used to analyse the TISC models. All but the copy_files.R are passed to the targets.R file to perform calculations and plotting. Each file within this directory will be described as fallows:

### copy_files.R

### find_basin_data.R

### get_decompaction_data.R

### get_subsidence_data.R

### get_well_tops.R

### packages.R

### utility_functions.R

For transparency, the fallowing plot demonstrates the relationship of functions used in the targets.R to create and pass data. Each function will also have thier own documentation for user assistance.
